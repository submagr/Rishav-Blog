## About me 
I am very curious about world. How it formed, and where it is going, interests me. Also, I am afraid that moron Trump will start the war soon. Maybe, my fear comes more from my stay in Japan.
I am a voracious reader. I am also interested in history of the world, particularly India. 

Academically, I'm B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Kanpur. I've been part of awesome BAJA SAE club. I've also held position of Assistant Coordinator at Counselling Service, IIT  Kanpur.

Currently, I'm working as a Mechanical Engineer at Mitsubishi Motors.


## About this blog
I never planned to start a blog. Just stumbled upon it, a random friend from college made this for me. So I thought, let's give it a try. 
In this blog, I'll write about my experiences from college to Japan to (data from future loading...). I'll also blurp about some economics, politics or some random thoughts from my mind.
